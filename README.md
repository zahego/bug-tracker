this is the most ambitious project with Java done with 3 people.

Updated Ver1.

The most basic GUI of Bug Tracker 3000 is completed (min, max, layout, pop up). For pop up function, I created extra JFrame instead of JInternalframe. JInternalframe might provide a better solution.
Min, Max functions are not too reusable, I will fix it in the next update version.
Database needs to be applied to created Profile function + Memberlist function. I will create a simple function to demonstrate first.
