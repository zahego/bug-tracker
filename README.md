## bug tracker 3000
A bug tracking program similar to Jira, Jetbrain and Trello, following agile development principle. The project is done without any guidance from school or tutorial as we cover everything from design phase to testing phase. Project is done purely in Java and its library.

## Motivation
We want to reapply what we learnt back into an actual application. Bug Tracker is among the core tools for a team of developer to use and work with so we figure what better way to get used to the tools than creating one from scratch.

## Getting Started
These instructions will guild you through the inital setting up process and 
highlight what the apps can do for you to explore on your own.
